Assignment 1 Data Mining SENG-474In this assignment I used two separate datasets:	1. Cleveland Heart Disease Data Set [1] 	2. Phishing Websites Data Set [2] 	For the Cleveland Heart Disease data set, I downloaded the processed.cleveland.data since it only has 14 attributes as compared to 76 attributes for the unprocessed data. The labels were missing from the dataset so I added them from the Data Set description. The software I used for this assignment is Weka [3] for implementing machine learning methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forests and Neural Networks. The report.pdf file contains information on parameters that I changed to evaluate these three different machine-learning algorithms. References: -[1] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease [Link for dataset][2] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites [Link for dataset][3] https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/ [Download Weka]
